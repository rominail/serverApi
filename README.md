Commodities for exercise purposes with assumptions :
- RSA key is 1024 and should be 4096
- HTTP protocol should be avoided and using most recent version of https (ssl / tls)
- No framework is used for setup purposes, and code is not properly segregated
- The JWT configuration and implementation could be better 
- Constants for database connexion
- CSRF is not implemented and should be
- UX is not part of the POC
- JWT token should be sent through headers and not body request

SETUP :
- In the config/env.php file edit everything to match your server config
- composer require lcobucci/jwt
- Change database name in database.sql
- "Execute" database.sql

TO TEST :
Username : robby
Password : password (yes, definitely the best password ever)

NOTE :
UserData are sanitized in the model just before being used
UserData is sanitized only before inserting in DB if possible though prepared requests are used 
BCrypt is used for password encryption
JWT is used for authentication purpose which is better than session for an API
